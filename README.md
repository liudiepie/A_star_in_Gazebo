# A_star_in_Gazebo
This project implements A star algorithm on 2D map.  
Based on the code in 2D implement, use turtlebot3 to simulate the path in Gazebo.  
## 2D implement 
Focus on 2D map and A star algorithm  
There are 8 options for each node  
User can adjust start point, goal point, RPM, and clearance by them  
## Turtlebot3 in Gazebo
After knowing how to generate the path with A star, we can simulate it in Gazebo 
Put the obstacles at the same place in 2D map and use burger as the robot  
Burger will follow the path to the goal position and avoid the obstacles.
